Security is one of the major concerns of the OI4 alliance. Securing connections, validating server and services is vital for IIoT.
Certificates are widely used for authentication, authorization and encryption. 
To handle a variety of certificates Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) are used. PKIs handle the whole livecycle of certificates, starting from the issuing to the revocation.

A central part of PKIs are Certificate Authorities (CA). A CA issues the certificates and add a reference to the certificate, that is has been issued by this CA.
Certificates issued by a CA can be validated with the help of the issuing CA. Furthermore, a CA can revoke certificates, e.g. when the key gets compromised.

A PKI brings a lot of benefits but also additional complexity in the handling.
